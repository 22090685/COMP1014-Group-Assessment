```{r}

### Test whether gender is independent of nap frequency.
```{r}
# Filter maleFx and femaleFx
FilteredStudy <- subset(SleepCogStudy, Gender %in% c("Male", "Female"))

genderTable <- table((FilteredStudy$Gender), (FilteredStudy$NapFrequency)) 
barplot(genderTable, col = c("pink", "skyblue"), beside = TRUE, legend = rownames(genderTable),
        main = "Nap Frequency by Gender",
        xlab = "Nap Frequency",
        ylab = "Count") 



# H0: Gender is dependent of nap frequency
# HA: Gender is dependent of nap frequency

chisq.test(genderTable)

# As the p-value is greater than 0, we reject the null hypothesis
```
